# Brouhard Lab 3D models

Here you'll find various 3D models for parts we print or machine in the lab.

To make them, we use the following machines:

- 3D printer: [Objet Eden 260VS from Stratasys](http://www.stratasys.com/3d-printers/objet-eden-260vs)
- Micro-Milling machine: [Datron Neo from Datron](https://www.datron.com/cnc-machines/datron-neo.php)

## List of Parts

- [Long Microtubules](./Long%20Microtubules): 11 and 13 PFs microtubule models that allow, once printed, to clearly the difference in twist.
